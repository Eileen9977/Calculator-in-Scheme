# Calculator-in-Scheme
1. With "String-input.scm" file provided, wrote a calculator with functions including: defining functions, using if-statements, using while-loops, and basic calculations; calculator input is post-fix based, and results would be stored into a stack which would not be erased as long as the program keeps running.
